# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm

This project implements the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm, which finds the length of the longest subsequence that is common to two given strings.

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, the task is to find the length of the longest subsequence that is common to both strings. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

For example, if `s1 = "ABCBDAB"` and `s2 = "BDCABA"`, the longest common subsequence is `"BCBA"`, and its length is `4`.


## Usage
Compile the file by typing `g++ main.cpp` in the terminal. You can specify your input in a `input.txt` file within the `input` directory and provide the name of the file inside the `main` function in `main.cpp`.

The first line of the `input.txt` file contains the first string, while the second line contains the second string.
